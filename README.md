### Python 3.10

# Flashcard_Program

The program allows to add, remove, practice, export and import multiple flashcards. On top of that, the program tracks logs and it is possible to export them using a built-in method. The user can interact with the program via the input, while export and import of the files can be done also via command line. 

The program is loosely based on the stages proposed by JetBrains, however it has been entirely designed and executed by the author.
